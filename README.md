Tethered is a multi-author story writing platform that revolutionizes collaborative storytelling


## This is how it works
On Tethered, any user can start a story by publishing a first chapter. Later, the story would get multiple proposals for the next chapter written , they'd be put to a vote, and the winning proposal would be connected or 'tethered' to the last chapter. This cycle would then be repeated again weekly, creating unending stories voted on by the public.

Tethered a space where the boundaries between author and reader blur, and stories come alive through the power of community. Imagine a world where narratives evolve dynamically, shaped by the collective creativity of thousands. That's the reality we've crafted with Tethered - a cutting-edge, multi-author story writing platform that's pushing the envelope of what's possible in collaborative content creation.

- Improved overall app performance

### 👨‍💻 Redesigned Touch API
To enhance the user experience, I've redesigned Flutter's native touch API:
- Supports complex nested scroll views
- Improves responsiveness in areas with overlapping interactive elements
- Custom gesture recognizers for intuitive story navigation

### 🐈 Complex Animation Procedures
Our app features intricate animations that enhance the user experience:
- Custom animation controllers for smooth transitions
- Optimized rendering pipeline for butter-smooth 60fps animations
- Choreographed multi-step animations for key user interactions

### 🚀 Scalable Backend Architecture
Leveraging Firebase, I've created a robust and scalable backend:
- Real-time database for instant updates across devices
